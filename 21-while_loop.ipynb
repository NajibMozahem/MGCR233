    "A while loop is used to execute a block of code multiple times as long as a condition is true. Each time the code is executed, the condition is checked again. If the condition is still true, the code is executed again. If the condition is false, the loop is exited and the program continues with the next line of code. Consider the following example:"

In this case, the condition is num < 5, which is true as long as num is less than 5. When num becomes 5, the condition becomes false and the loop stops. After the loop stops, execution continues with the next line of code, which is the print statement.
